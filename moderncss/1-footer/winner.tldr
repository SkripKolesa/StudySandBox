After seeing grid, you may have a moment of thinking it's clearly superior.
However, if you add more elements between the header and footer you need to update your template
(or ensure there's always a wrapping element such as a div to not affect any nested semantics/hierarchy).

On the other hand, the flexbox method is usable across various templates with multiple block elements in the midsection -
for example, a series of <article> elements instead of a single <main> for an archive page.

So as with all techniques, it depends on the project :) But we can all agree it's amazing to have these modern CSS layout methods!
